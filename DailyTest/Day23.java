/*
 Diagonal With odd integers

The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input. The program must print the
number of diagonals having only odd integers that are parallel to the top-left to bottom-right
diagonal and the top-right to bottom-left diagonal in the matrix.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of diagonals having only odd integers in the
matrix.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 5
60 37 26 98 73
29 50 32 52 43
52 19 29 81 33
13 94 17 63 80
90 25 77 11 54
Output:
6
Explanation:
The diagonals that are parallel to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal and having only odd integers
are highlighted below.
60 37 26 98 73
29 50 32 52 43
52 19 29 81 33
13 94 17 63 80
90 25 77 11 54
The diagonals that are parallel to the top-right to bottom-left diagonal and having only odd integers
are highlighted below.
60 37 26 98 73
29 50 32 52 43
52 19 29 81 33
13 94 17 63 80
90 25 77 11 54
Here the total number of diagonals with only odd integers is 6. So 6 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 3
354 234 259
104 384 352
331 289 127
127 261 288
Output:
4
