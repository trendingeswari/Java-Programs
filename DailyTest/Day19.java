/*
 Shift Digits & Doubles

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must form an integer X by shifting
the digits at even positions in N once to the right. Then the program must print 2*X as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
10 <= N <= 10^15
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains 2*X.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
123456
Output:
326508
Explanation:
In the given integer 123456, the digits in even positions are 2, 4, 6.
After shifting the digits in even positions for 1 time to the right, the integer becomes 163254.
After doubling the integer value, the integer becomes 326508 (2x163254).
Hence the output is 326508
Example Input/Output 2:
789335467
Output:
1539666914
