***************************** 1st chapter SELECT BASICS *****************************

-> To select all row and column
    
    select * from table_Name;

-> To select particular column and row 

    select tile, genre from table_Name;

-> to create table_Name

    create table table_Name(id INT,name VARCHAR[1001],size INT);

-> count the something 'count(*)' fetch the number of rows in the result set returned by sql

    select count(*) from table_Name

-> 'where' clause used to fetch row meeting desired condition. 
    NOTE: string value we must enclose filtering value in 'where'clause is single quotes ''

    select * from table_Name where language ='chinease';

-> 'where' cluase used for the particular condition .eg: employee name whose salary is 10000 from employee table
    note: result is order by column name in ascending order

    select name from employee where salary=10000 order by name;

-> if we want to make multiple condition in 'where'clause we use the 'and'

    select * from movie where language='chinease' and releaseyear=2012;

-> if we want to make either condition in 'where' clause we use the 'or'

    select * from movie where language='chinease' or releaseyear=2012;

-> if we want to select a not equal condition

    select * from movie where language != 'chinease';

-> if we want to make greater than || greater than or equal to in 'where'clause  

    select * from movie where releaseyear >= 2012;

->if we want to make less than || less than or equal to in 'where'clause

    select * from movie where releaseyear <= 2012;

***************************** 2nd chapter SELECT OPERATORS*****************************

-> 'order by' is used to sort the record retreiving in either ascending or descending order. 
    Eg: employee table to sort record in ascending order by name , salary .

    select * from employee order by name, salary asc;

-> order by using 'or'
    eg: to select name of the student who score more than 50 in subject1 or less than 80 in subject2

    select name from student where sub1 >50 or sub2 <80 order by name;

->'limit'clause used for maximum number of record to be retrived 
    eg: select players with top five scores from player table
    note:1) result set is ordered by column score in descending order
         2) top five records are selected from the result using 'limit'clause

    select name , score from player order by score desc limit 5;
