/*
 Continuous Alphabet and Curly Braces

 The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must enclose
the contiguous alphabets (in alphabetical order by ignoring the case) with a pair of curly braces {}.
Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. If there are no such contiguous
alphabets in the string S, the program must print the string S as it is.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
DefeaT
Output:
{Def}eaT
Explanation:
The contiguous alphabets in the string DefeaT are D, e and f. So they are enclosed within a pair of
curly braces.
Hence the output is {Def}eaT
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
stUdeNt
Output:
{stU}{de}Nt
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
onnne
Output:
onnne
