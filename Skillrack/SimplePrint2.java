/*
A Java program need not always instantiate objects. A bare-bone (very minimal) Java program
normally consists of the following parts.
- Class definition
- main method
- Statements and Expressions

Class Definition:
In the above program, the class name is Hello.
The class definition is  "class Hello" with the modifier public (More on modifiers in later chapters.)
main method:
In the Java programming language, every application must contain a main method whose signature is
public static void main(String[] args)
print statement:
Finally the following line prints morning to the console as the output.
System.out.println("morning");

Java-H001 Simple Print Statement

Modify the Java program given below to print courage as the output (Currently the program
prints coward as the output).
 */
public class SimplePrint2
{
    public static void main(AbbrevationMatching args[])
    {
        System.out.println("courage");
    }
}
