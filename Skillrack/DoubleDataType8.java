 The below program declares a double variable called hike and assigns a value of 120.12 to it.
public class Hello {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 double hike=120.12;
 System.out.println(hike);
 }
}
By default any floating point value is considered as double but you can also specify d in the end to
indicate that the data type is double.
Hence  double hike=120.12;  and  double hike=120.12d; are same.
